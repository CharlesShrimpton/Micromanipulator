First sketch plan:

Micromanipulator project

week1
- git / github: create repository from template on badenlab github page.
- writing documents in markdown.
- Arduino: learn how to make a led blink
- Serial communication: send messages to the computer

week2
- analog: read a potentiometer (variable resistor) value
- motor drives
- Stepper motor

- connect arduino to 1 axis and control it with computer commands/potentiometer turn

- check variability in positioning
- check smallest movement possible



- presentation
- documenting things for report
- injection experiments.
